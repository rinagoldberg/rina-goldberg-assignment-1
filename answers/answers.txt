b. Hello, my name is Rina Goldberg. I am a fourth year at Brandeis and I am
an Environmental Studies major and a Climate Justice Science Policy (CJSP) minor. I am not 100% sure what I want in my career, but I am interested in becoming an environmental scientist or ecologist. I want a career that's hands on and allows me to travel. I am taking this course because I would like to learn how to code. Even though I have no coding experience, I think it would be a useful skill for jobs. My hobbies include watching TV shows/movies, listening to music (pop), hanging out with friends, video games, and I'm trying to teach myself how to knit.
