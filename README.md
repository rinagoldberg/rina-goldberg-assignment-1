Rina Goldberg


Hello, my name is Rina Goldberg. I am a fourth year at Brandeis and I am 
an Environmental Studies major and a Climate Justice Science Policy (CJSP) 
minor. I am not 100% sure what I want my career to be, but I am interested in 
becoming an environmental scientist or ecologist. I want a career that's 
hands on and allows me to travel. I am taking this course because I would 
like to learn how to code. Even though I have no coding experience, I think 
it would be a useful skill for jobs. My hobbies include watching TV 
shows/movies, listening to music (pop), hanging out with friends, 
videogames, and I'm trying to teach myself how to knit.
